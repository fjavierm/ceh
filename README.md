# CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker

This repository is not going to be a coding repository. The purpose of this repository is to store my notes about the 'Certified Ethical Hacker' learning and study.

The reason to use this format instead of the usual blog format, [Binary Coders](https://www.binarycoders.dev), is that this is going to be a live project, I wanted to be free to edit, change or redo the different sections and be able to write this in a non-linear way. Be able to review things and add new information to the sections already finished.

I hope, if you have landed here, this document can be of any use for you.
