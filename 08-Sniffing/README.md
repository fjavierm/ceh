# Sniffing

A packet sniffer is a utility that listens on a network for transferred data. Packet sniffing allows individuals to capture data as it is transmitted over a network. This technique is used by network professionals to diagnose network issues, and by malicious users to capture unencrypted data, like passwords and usernames.  Using sniffers attackers can gain knowledge of information that might be helpful on further attacks.

To be able to use sniffing techniques the promiscuous mode needs to be enabled in the network interface, this will allow the capture of all the traffic in the network, not just the traffic directed to the interface. Promiscuous mode is a mode of the interface in which the network interface card (NIC) respond for every package it receives. Using these techniques anyone can sniff traffic in a LAN.

There are two types of sniffing techniques:

* **Active sniffing**: Active sniffing is the sniffing type in which attackers have to send additional packets to the connected device such as a switch to start receiving packets. As it is known, a unicast packet from the switch is transmitted to a specific port only. Attackers use certain techniques such as _MAC Flooading_, _DHCP Attacks_, _DNS Poisoning_, _Sitch Port Stealing_, _ARP Poisoning_ and _Spoofing_ to monitor traffic passing through the switch.

* **Passive sniffing**: Passive sniffing is the sniffing type in which there is no need of sending additional packets or interfering the device such as a hub to receive packages. As it is known, a hab broadcast every packet to its port, which helps the attacker to monitor all traffic passing through the hub without any effort.

Two different types of network analysers can be found. Those based on hardware and those based on software.

* **Hardware Analysers**: These are physical pieces of equipment that can be plugged into a network and analyse the traffic without interfering with it. The mayor advantages they offer are that they are mobile, flexible and throughput.

* **Software Analyser**: So call switch port analysis (SPAN). Easy to configure and start, used to diagnose most of the network problems enterprises. And administrator can just run one if one of its users is having problems. The can be configured to monitor inbound, outbound traffic or both. They have some limitations, for example, some types of traffic can no be forwarded like BDPUs, CDP, DTP, VTP, STP. And, if a source port with higher bandwidth than the destination port is used, some of the traffic, if the link gets congested, can be dropped.

## Wiretapping

Wiretapping is a type of sniffing. This maybe sounds like an old fashion thing saw in films but, multiple governmental, security or enforcement agencies used to monitor third party conversations, and usually, it needs a court order or some kind of legal permission. But, attackers can do the same without the legal considerations. Wiretapping is basically electrical tap on the telephone line.

Wiretapping can be classified into its own two types:

* **Active wiretapping**: This type includes monitoring, recording and maybe alter a communication.

* **Passive wiretapping**: This type, just, includes monitoring and recording a communication.

When talking about active sniffing some techniques have been named to help attackers to generate traffic in a network and gather information. It is time to describe these techniques:

## MAC Attacks

 Stands for "Media Access Control Address and a MAC address is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network. The MAC address is manufactured into every network card, such as an Ethernet card or Wi-Fi card, and therefore cannot be changed.

Because there are millions of networkable devices in existence, and each device needs to have a unique MAC address, there must be a very wide range of possible addresses. For this reason, MAC addresses are made up of six two-digit hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. For example, an Ethernet card may have a MAC address of 00:0d:83:b1:c0:8e.

All devices on the same network subnet have different MAC addresses. MAC addresses are very useful in diagnosing network issues, such as problems with IP addresses. MAC addresses are useful for network diagnosis because they never change, as opposed to a dynamic IP address, which can change from time to time. For a network administrator, that makes a MAC address a more reliable way to identify senders and receivers of data on the network.

### ARP Table

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol for mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. A table is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address. ARP provides the protocol rules for making this correlation and providing address conversion in both directions.

### CAM Table

Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table is a system memory construct used by Ethernet switch logic which stores information such as MAC addresses available on physical ports with their associated VLAN Parameters. The CAM table, or content addressable memory table, is present in all switches for layer 2 switching. This allows switches to facilitate communications between connected stations at high speed and in full-duplex regardless of how many devices are connected to the switch. Switches learn MAC addresses from the source address of Ethernet frames on the ports, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) response packets.

### MAC Flooding

The MAC Flooding is an attacking method intended to compromise the security of the network switches. Usually, the switches maintain a table structure called MAC Table. As it has been already seen, the hubs broadcast the data to the entire network allowing the data to reach all hosts on the network but switches send the data to the specific machines which the data is intended to be sent. This goal is achieved by the use of MAC tables.

 The aim of the MAC Flooding is to takedown this MAC Table. In a typical MAC Flooding attack, the attacker sends Ethernet Frames in a huge number. When sending many Ethernet Frames to the switch, these frames will have various sender addresses. The intention of the attacker is consuming the memory of the switch that is used to store the MAC address table. The MAC addresses of legitimate users will be pushed out of the MAC Table. Now the switch cannot deliver the incoming data to the destination system. So a considerable number of incoming frames will be flooded at all ports.

MAC Address Table is full and it is unable to save new MAC addresses. It will lead the switch to enter into a fail-open mode and the switch will now behave like a network hub. It will forward the incoming data to all ports broadcasting it.

As the attacker is a part of the network, the attacker will also get the data packets intended for the victim machine. So that the attacker will be able to steal sensitive data from the communication of the victim and other computers. Usually, a packet analyzer is used to capture these sensitive data.

### Switch Port Stealing

This attack uses MAC flooding to sniff traffic between two hosts. Switch port stealing works by stealing the switches port of the target host. Switches learn to bind MAC addresses to each port by seeing the source MAC addresses in the packets that arrive from each port. The user wanting to sniff the traffic steals the switches port to the target host so the traffic will go through it first, then to the target host.

The attack starts by having the attacker flood the switch with forged gratuitous ARP packets with the source MAC address being that of the target host and the destination MAC address being that of the attacker. The flooding process described here is different than the flooding process used in CAM table flooding. Since the destination MAC address of each flooding packet is the attacker's MAC address, the switch will not forward these packets to other ports, meaning they will not be seen by other hosts on the network. Now, a race condition exists because the target host will send packets too. The switch will see packets with the same source MAC address on two different ports and will constantly change the binding of the MAC address to the port. Remember that the switch binds a MAC address to a single port. If the attacker is fast enough, packets intended for the target host will be sent to the attacker's switch port and not the target host. The attacker has now stolen the target hosts' switch port. When a packet arrives at the attacker, the attacker performs an ARP request asking for the target hosts' IP address. Next, the attacker stops the flooding and waits for the ARP reply. When the attacker receives the reply, it means that the target hosts' switch port has been restored to its original binding. Now, the attacker can sniff the packet, then forward it to the target host and restart the flooding process waiting for new packets.

### Defence Against MAC Attacks

There are several ways to mitigate these packet sniffing attacks. The first of these actions is to enable port security on the switch. Port security is a feature found on high-end switches that ties a physical port to a MAC address. This allows you to either specify one or more MAC addresses for each port or learn a certain number of MAC addresses per port. A change in the specified MAC address for a port or flooding of a port can be controlled in many different ways through switch administration.

An important fact to know is that port security capabilities are dependant on the platform meaning that different switch manufacturers have different capabilities.

The second way to mitigate sniffing is through the use of static ARP entries. Static ARP entries are permanent entries that wonâ€™t time out from the ARP cache. This method does have a drawback though. Administrators have to create new entries on every host on the network every time a new host is connected, or when a network card is replaced.

The final method of defence is through detection. Intrusion detection systems can be configured to listen for high amounts of ARP traffic. There are also tools specifically designed to listen for ARP replies on networks. This method is prone to reporting false positives though. It should be remembered that detection is always an important step in mitigation.

## DHCP Attacks

### DHCP

Acronym of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network protocol used on IP networks where a DHCP server automatically assigns an IP address and other information to each host on the network so they can communicate efficiently with other endpoints.

In addition to the IP address, DHCP also assigns the subnet mask, a default gateway address, a domain name server (DNS) address and other pertinent configuration parameters. Request for Comments (RFC) 2131 and 2132 define DHCP as an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - defined standard based on the BOOTP protocol.

When working with DHCP, itâ€™s important to understand all of the components.  Below is a list of them and what they do:

* **DHCP server**: A networked device running the DCHP service that holds IP addresses and related configuration information. This is most typically a server or a router but could be anything that acts as a host, such as an SD-WAN appliance.

* **DHCP client**: The endpoint that receives configuration information from a DHCP server. This can be a computer, mobile device, IoT endpoint or anything else that requires connectivity to the network.  Most are configured to receive DHCP information by default.

* **IP address pool**: The range of addresses that are available to DHCP clients. Addresses are typically handed out sequentially from lowest to highest.

* **Subnet**: IP networks can be partitioned into segments known as subnets. Subnets help keep networks manageable.

* **Lease**: The length of time for which a DHCP client holds the IP address information. When a lease expires, the client must renew it.

* **DHCP relay**: A router or host that listens for client messages being broadcast on that network and then forwards them to a configured server. The server then sends responses back to the relay agent that passes them along to the client. This can be used to centralize DHCP servers instead of having a server on each subnet.

### DHCP Starvation Attack

DHCP starvation attack is an attack vector in which an attacker broadcasts a large number of DHCP requests packets with some spoofed MAC Address. DHCP starvation attack is called an attack on a computer network, in which the entire range of available and DHCP award IP addresses to a single client be registered. The automatic assignment of network addresses to other computers is thus made impossible. This is a sort of DHCP flooding attack or DHCP denial of service attack in which all the IP addresses of the IP pool will be consumed by the attacker and no new client will be able to connect to the DHCP server.

### Rogue DHCP Server Attack

A rogue DHCP server is a DHCP server which is on a network but is not authorized and permissible by a network administrator. This DHCP server is created by the attacker by which when all the IP addresses will be starved it will make the victim connect to its own malicious DHCP server into that same network.

### Preventing DHCP Starvation Attacks and Rogue Servers

Port security can currently prevent a DHCP starvation attack launched from a PC connected to a switch that is using a tool such as Gobbler. The inability of the attack to succeed is due more to a limitation of the tool than the mitigation offered by port security. The only reason such an attack fails is that Gobbler uses a different source MAC address to generate a different DHCP request and can be mitigated by port protection.

Rogue DHCP servers can be mitigated by the DHCP snooping feature. DHCP snooping is a feature available on switches. In order to defend against rogue DHCP servers, configure DHCP snooping on the port on which the valid DHCP server is connected. Once you configure DHCP snooping, it does not allow other ports on the switch to respond to DHCP discover packets sent by clients. Thus, even if an attacker manages to build a rogue DHCP server and connects to the switch, he or she cannot respond to DHCP discover packets.

## ARP Poisoning

### ARP

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to find the hardware (MAC) address of a host from an IP address. ARP is used on Ethernet LANs because hosts that want to communicate with each other need to know their respective MAC addresses. It is a request-reply protocol; ARP request messages are used to request the MAC address, while ARP reply messages are used to send the requested MAC address.

### ARP Poisoning Attack

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning or ARP spoofing is when an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network (LAN) to link an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker's MAC address is linked to an authentic IP address, the attacker can receive any messages directed to the legitimate MAC address. As a result, the attacker can intercept, modify or block communicates to the legitimate MAC address.

ARP spoofing can be used for:

* Session Hijacking
* Denial-of-Service Attack
* Man-in-the-Middle Attack
* Package Sniffing
* Data Interception
* Connection Hijacking
* VoIP tapping
* Connection Reseting
* Stealing Passwords

### Preventing ARP spoofing Attack

* **Rely on Virtual Private Networks**: One way to prevent ARP spoofing from happening in the first place is to rely on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). When you connect to the internet, you typically first connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in order to connect to another website. However, when you use a VPN, youâ€™re using an encrypted tunnel that largely blocks your activity from ARP spoofing hackers. Both the method by which youâ€™re conducting the online activity and the data that goes through it is encrypted.

* **Use a Static ARP**: Creating a static ARP entry in your server can help reduce the risk of spoofing. If you have two hosts that regularly communicate with one another, setting up a static ARP entry creates a permanent entry in your ARP cache that can help add a layer of protection from spoofing.

* **Get a Detection Tool**: Even with ARP knowledge and techniques in place, it is not always possible to detect a spoofing attack. Hackers are becoming increasingly stealthy at remaining undetected and use new technologies and tools to stay ahead of their victims. Instead of strictly focusing on prevention, make sure you have a detection method in place. Using a third-party detection tool can help you see when a spoofing attack is happening so you can work on stopping it in its tracks.

* **Avoid Trust Relationships**: Some systems rely on IP trust relationships that will automatically connect to other devices in order to transmit and share information. However, you should completely avoid relying on IP trust relationships in your business. When your devices use IP addresses only to verify another machine or user's identity, it is easy for a hacker to infiltrate and spoof your ARP.

* **Set-Up Packet Filtering**: Some ARP attackers will send ARP packets across the LAN that contain an attackerâ€™s MAC address and the victimâ€™s IP address. Once the packets have been sent, an attacker can start receiving data or wait and remain relatively undetected as they ramp up to launch a follow-up attack. And when a malicious packet has infiltrated your system, it can be difficult to stop a follow-up attack and ensure your system is clean.

* **Look at Your Malware Monitoring Settings**: The antivirus and malware tools you already use may offer some recourse against ARP spoofing. Look at your malware monitoring settings and look for categories and selections that monitor for suspicious ARP traffic from endpoints. You should also enable any ARP spoofing prevention options and stop any endpoint processes that send suspicious ARP traffic.

* **Run Spoofing Attacks**: Identification and prevention are key to preventing spoofing attacks. However, you can increase your chances of staying safe and protecting your data by running your own spoofing attacks. Work with your security officer or IT team to run a spoofing attack to see if the techniques youâ€™re using are enough to keep your system and data safe.
